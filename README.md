# Edge Function Github AutoDeploy

Azion **Edge Function GitHub AutoDeploy** simplifies the deployment of edge functions integrated with Github Actions directly on the edge of the network. By using this template, you only need to code your edge function, and the deployment is done through GitHub Actions.
